# ML Prediction Model Explorative Project

## Objective:
This project aims to explore the development application of Machine Learning Regression Models to predict housing prices based on real-world data.
It utilizes tools such as pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, and scikit-learn.

## Credits: 
This project and its code is directly adapted from lectures from the second and third edition of the textbooks "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems" by Aurelien Geron
